Galaxy tool to draw a Venn Diagram with up to 3 sets
====================================================

This tool is copyright 2011-2017 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using both the Galaxy and Biopython library
functions) to extract ID lists from tabular, FASTA, FASTQ or SFF files to build
sets, which are then drawn using the R limma package function vennDiagram
(called from Python using rpy).

This tool is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/venn_list


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download the tool
and the Python dependencies Biopython and rpy, and the R/Bioconductor package
limma.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install:

* ``venn_list.py`` (the Python script)
* ``venn_list.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder ``tools/plotting`` next to other
graph drawing tools, or a dedicated ``tools/venn_list`` directory.

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later, and the R/Bioconductor
package limma. You should already have rpy installed for other Galaxy tools.

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. The suggested location is in the "Graph/Display Data" section. Simply add
the line::

  <tool file="venn_list/venn_list.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also move/copy the ``test-data/`` files
under Galaxy's ``test-data/`` folder. Then::

    ./run_tests.sh -id venn_list

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were initially developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

Development has now moved to a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy

For pushing a release to the test or main "Galaxy Tool Shed", use the following
Planemo commands (which requires you have set your Tool Shed access details in
``~/.planemo.yml`` and that you have access rights on the Tool Shed)::

    $ planemo shed_update -t testtoolshed --check_diff tools/venn_list/
    ...

or::

    $ planemo shed_update -t toolshed --check_diff tools/venn_list/
    ...

To just build and check the tar ball, use::

    $ planemo shed_upload --tar_only tools/venn_list/
    ...
    $ tar -tzf shed_upload.tar.gz 
    tools/venn_list/README.rst
    tools/venn_list/tool_dependencies.xml
    tools/venn_list/venn_list.py
    tools/venn_list/venn_list.xml
    test-data/magic.pdf
    test-data/rhodopsin_proteins.fasta
    test-data/venn_list.tabular
