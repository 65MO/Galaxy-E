# WHAT IT DOES
TopHit_namefilter is a SIMPLE filter to keep just the TOPHIT / first [N] occurrence(s) of some
identifier. This is  useful for keeping only the first N tophits of for instance BLAST when
multiple hits were returned (and you don't want to rerun the BLAST analysis). Of course it is NOT
restricted to BLAST and can basically filter ANY tabular data for uniqueness.

Please be aware that NO additional filtering or checking is done on for instance E values of BLAST hits.
Tophit = FIRST hit...not necessarily the best.. If multiple hits are selected to be returned
they will NOT be sorted (see below example of a number of 2 hits occurring somewhere else in the
input and therefore in the output file).
